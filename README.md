# PyUVM SPI Verification Component

This project develops an open-source, reusable SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) verification component using PyUVM — a Python-based, vendor-independent implementation of UVM.

## ✨ Planned Features

- SPI Producer and Consumer agents
- Support for SPI modes 0–3 (CPOL/CPHA)
- Protocol checking and error injection
- Functional coverage and scoreboard
- Example testbenches
- 100% Python, runs with open-source simulation tools

## 🧭 Goals

- Lower the barrier to professional hardware verification
- Provide open-source alternatives to SystemVerilog-based UVM environments
- Empower open hardware and embedded design communities
